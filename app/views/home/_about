    I make a living spinning and weaving words to guide views and readers to a destination. As a non-technical person, I communicate complex technical material in a way that's easy for your audience to follow. From discovering the right message and outlining key points through draft and final copy -- I bring ideas into focus.

    Originally from St. Louis, I'm an Atlanta-based freelance writer with more than 18 years of writing, editing, marketing communications and public relations experience with B2B companies. I hold a Bachelor of Journalism degree from the Missouri School of Journalism at the University of Missouri-Columbia. I'm also a Georgia Master Gardener who believes David Austin English roses can grow and flourish in humid Atlanta.
